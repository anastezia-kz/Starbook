End of second module - Project at IronHack 

"A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away...."

It is a period of coding war. Rebel spaceships, striking from a virtual base, have won their first victory against the evil Ironhack Empire.
During the battle, Rebel students managed to steal secret plans to the Empire's ultimate weapon, the JAVASCRIPT STAR, an armored space station with enough power to destroy an entire web application.
Pursued by the Empire's sinister students, Teacher Assistants race home aboard their starship, custodian of the stolen plans that can save their codes and restore freedom to the web application galaxy....

Rebel students continued fighting against all the web rules, creating modules, hbs views files, routes in the space, and APIs connections. In the infinite timeline of the galaxy, three weeks only were assigned to the Rebel students to complete their secret plan. It seemed to be impossible.

 “I find your lack of faith disturbing.” — Darth Vader (the Javascript's Vader)

As a result of the plan, a social galaxy-network was created. A complex signup and login system only allows a few selected candidates to access the secrets of the Rebel students.

Once logged in, the possibility to spy other users is possible. As well as the possibility to add some thoughts to the users' profile. There was only the problem of trusting the system.

“Do. Or do not. There is no try.” — Yoda

So galaxy travelers started doing it: navigating the possibilities of the web application and the results of the Rebel students' plan. There were still some things not working but...

“Never tell me the odds!” — Han Solo

Do you really wanna try? Then go ahead, but don't say we haven't warned you...
